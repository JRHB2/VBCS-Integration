# Set up page to show relationships

Now, we want to list the Follower, Following, and Mutual users when the corresponding word on the page is clicked. First, however, we have to do some more page set up. <br>
Create two variables:
-title, which will hold the heading for our list
-relationsList, which will hold the returned list
On page designer, drag and drop a Heading component below the panel, and set its Text value to `title`. Right below that, drag and drop a Paragraph component. Make it only one column wide. This will force the line to wrap, so that each listed user appears on a new line. Set its Text value to `relationsList`. <br>
