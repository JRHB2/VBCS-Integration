## Introduction

In this part of the lab, we'll learn a bit about how Graph Databases work, and see how to integrate them with VBCS. Specifically, we'll be using a free Graph Database called Neo4j.

## Connecting VBCS to a Graph Database (Neo4j)

### **STEP 1**: Set Up Neo4j Database

<details>
  <summary> Make a GrapheneDB Account and Database </summary>
  <br>
  
  GrapheneDB is an easy way to get up and running with Neo4j, with a free sandbox trial. <br> Visit [Graphene DB](https://app.graphenedb.com/) and sign up for an account. Login to the dashboard, then click `Create Database`.
